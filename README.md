# Branching Strategies
I will make use of GitFlow strategy for each project because it offers a detailed structure with a few clearly defined branches. 
This strategy will allow me to use each type of branch for parallel processing and provide quality assurance for all the projects.

* Master Branch - I will deploy my code in the master branch, which I will eventually merge with all other code branches into.

* Development Branch - Before eventually merging the development branch with the master, I will first integrate all of the features and modifications into the development branch. Consider it to be a master branch that is virtually "pre-production." This branch will give rise to the feature and release branches.

* Feature Branch - I will create new features on feature branches, one branch for each feature. With the help of these branches, it is simple to track versioning at a more granular level and to have different teams or engineers working on distinct features simultaneously.

* Release Branch - This branch will only be used for release-related tasks including QA, bug fixes, and documentation. I will merge with the master branch when the release is prepared, and then deploy from there.

* Hotfix Branch - I will utilise hotfix branches to only patch production code. To swiftly resolve issues and test the patches without immediately affecting production code (until it's ready to merge), I will isolate problematic code from the master branch.

# .gitignore
* In order to instruct Git which files and directories to ignore when I make a commit, I will create a.gitignore file in the root directory of each repository. I will also Commit the .gitignore file to each repository to make the ignore rules available to anyone that clone the repository.

# Credentials
* Credentials will be stored in a file that is restricted to private viewing to safely secure the information from being compromised
* Since the repository and project is public, only the invited markers/lecturers will oly be given access to read and access other information 

# Portfolio of Evidence
For my POE, I'm required to do several things which is aligned to the requirements of each project. Here is a list of the following items needed for me to compilke my POE:
* Attend all classes 
* Create a LinkdeIn account
* Join CMPG 323 LinkedIn group
* Contributing to the class LinkedIn group
* Create a GitHub account
* Join UiPath community forum
* Join Microsoft community forum
* Attend atleast one community meetup
* Submit all my projects
* Complete Git training
* Complete Scrum training
* Complete Robotic Process Automation training
* Complete Cloud training
* Complete Data Visualisation Reporting training
* Use of .gitignore files throughout the semester
* Use of ReadME.Md files throughout the semester
* Use GitHub project board throughout the semester
* Update my GitHub overview repository throughout the semester

Furthermore, I will aslo make use of other online community, social media platforms, YouTube to enance my understanding and knowledge.
